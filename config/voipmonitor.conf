# If 'query_cache' is disabled on the server and the server/client feature is enabled (i.e., remote sniffers send CDRs

# Options for enabling table compression:
# The default is InnoDB page compression. The old compression method used "ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED," which relies on gzip 
# and is too slow for high call-per-second traffic (>= 5000 CDRs per second), and also depends on CPU base frequency.
# MySQL >= 5.6 (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-page-compression.html) supports InnoDB page compression, 
# which is superior to ROW_FORMAT. To use the new InnoDB page compression with MySQL, set mysqlcompress_type = compression="lz4."
# MariaDB >= 10.1.22 (https://mariadb.com/kb/en/innodb-page-compression/) also supports InnoDB page compression, which 
# is controlled by innodb_compression_algorithm=lz4 in your MariaDB configuration. Confirm that lz4 is compiled by checking 
# Innodb_have_lz4, and then set mysqlcompress_type=PAGE_COMPRESSED=1.

# Tip: One key difference between ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED and InnoDB page compression is that the latter keeps only 
# uncompressed pages in the InnoDB buffer pool, whereas the former keeps both. Another advantage is that you can use 
# the fast lz4 compression if gzip becomes a bottleneck.
# To transition from older compression methods (defined by ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED) to the new InnoDB page compression, 
# you can use the following ALTER TABLE commands: 
#
# MySQL:  
# ALTER TABLE cdr ROW_FORMAT=dynamic COMPRESSION="lz4"; 
# MariaDB:
# ALTER TABLE cdr ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC `page_compressed`=1;
# 
# Run this command for each cdr* table you wish to keep compressed. Alternatively, you can drop all cdr tables if retaining 
# data is not required; VoIPmonitor will create them automatically for you.
# Note: InnoDB page compression requires the ROW_FORMAT to be "dynamic," and the COMPRESSION keyword defines the compression 
# algorithm (lz4 is currently the fastest).

# You don't need to specify mysqlcompress_type unless you want to use an older compression method or change the default lz4 
# compression algorithm. The valid value for mysqlcompress_type depends on your MySQL server version and whether you are 
# using MySQL or MariaDB; they have different options:

# This is the new InnoDB page compression for MySQL (not compatible with MariaDB) - this is the default and recommended option.
#mysqlcompress_type = compression="lz4"

# This is the new and only page compression option for MariaDB (not compatible with MySQL).
# The compression algorithm for MariaDB is automatically selected in this order: lz4, lzma, zlib.
# If MariaDB is not compiled with lz4 or lzma, zlib will be used, which is not recommended for high call-per-second traffic.
# This is the default option for MariaDB if not specified.
#mysqlcompress_type = PAGE_COMPRESSED=1

# This is the old compression format for MySQL (not recommended now).
#mysqlcompress_type = ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED  

# note: you do not need to specify mysqlcompress_type - it will be automatically chosen to the best option based on mysql/mariadb verison


# Load configuration from the database table 'sensor_conf' using the 'id_sensor' value (SELECT * FROM sensor_conf WHERE id_sensor = N).
# If 'id_sensor' is not set and 'mysqlloadconfig' is enabled, the first row in the database with 'id_sensor IS NULL' will be loaded.

# VoIPMonitor Configuration for Sniffing Mode
# VoIPMonitor can either sniff network traffic directly from a network interface or read from files.
# It supports GRE and ERSPAN encapsulation without requiring additional configuration.

# Interface Configuration
# 'interface' specifies the network interface(s) on which to listen.
# Using 'any' will cause VoIPMonitor to listen on all network interfaces. Note: Using "any" won't put interfaces into promiscuous mode.
# If you need to enable promiscuous mode manually, use a command like "ifconfig eth0 promisc".
# For multiple interfaces, provide a list separated by commas. For example: interface = eth0,eth1

# To listen on both eth0 and eth1:
#interface = eth0,eth1

# interface_libpcap_filter #
# Defines custom libpcap filters per network interface, allowing traffic load distribution across multiple virtual 
# interfaces, each handled by separate processing threads in VoIPmonitor. This significantly improves packet 
# processing performance in high-traffic environments by parallelizing the capture and processing workload.
# this is typically needed for AWS EC2 instances which has limits 2.2M packets per second per one libpcap 
# instance (in this case DPDK should be better choice). 
# whenever there is 100% si (software interrupts) in TOP when reading packets from the interface (which can be seen also by 
# simply running tcpdump) you can use interface_libpcap_filter to split the traffic 
# syntax: 
# Multiple lines or semicolon-separated (;) entries are supported:
#interface_libpcap_filter = <interface> : <libpcap_filter_expression>

# When multiple filters are defined for the same physical interface using interface_libpcap_filter, 
# VoIPmonitor internally creates multiple libpcap handler instances. Each handler independently applies its own 
# filter and captures matched packets. However, libpcap itself does not create additional kernel threads per filter. 
# Instead, VoIPmonitor initiates multiple user-space threads, each calling pcap_loop separately, thereby parallelizing 
# packet reading and processing in user space. This approach helps distribute CPU load effectively across available cores, 
# maximizing the packet processing capacity.

#In this example, traffic on interface eth0 is divided into two separate capture streams, each with 
# its own libpcap filter and processing thread.

#interface_libpcap_filter = eth0 : port 5060
#interface_libpcap_filter = eth0 : not port 5060

#or combined:
#interface_libpcap_filter = eth0 : port 5060; eth0 : not port 5060


# Enable this setting to 'yes' if you require Ethernet encapsulation while sniffing on the 'any' interface. 
# This is necessary only if you need to merge PCAP files with differing encapsulations. Default: no
#convert_dlt_sll2en10 = no

# To listen on all interfaces:

# Default is 3200 bytes, and 6000 bytes if SSL/HTTP sniffing is enabled.
# Rare use cases may require a larger snapshot length.

# Packet Capture Filter
# Specify a PCAP filter to limit the types of packets that are captured.

# WARNING - if you need to sniff IPinIP (mirrored packets from voipmonitor) filter = udp will filter all those packets. In this case just disable filter.
# WARNING - this rule "udp or (vlan and udp)" will not capture double VLAN tagged packets
#filter = udp or (vlan and udp)

# IP Filter for Sniffing
# If you want to filter based on IP addresses, especially in a sender sniffer setup, use 'interface_ip_filter'.
# Using 'filter = host ...' can be CPU-intensive and lead to packet loss.
# Multiple 'interface_ip_filter' options can be specified, with either specific IPs or IP ranges.

# This allows client sensors to be behind NAT but still reachable from the GUI.
# Client sensors are dynamically registered by the server's sensor.
# All communication between the server and client sensors is encrypted.
# Currently, only one server sensor is supported. All other sensors must act as clients.
# By default, the client processes data, saves pcap files locally, and sends SQL queries to the server's sensor for execution.

## old packet mirroring feature  ###########################

# In this mode, the sender packages data into a compressed stream and sends it over TCP to a remote sniffer.
# If you intend to use this sniffer solely for mirroring, you'll need to configure the interface, packetbuffer_* options,
# enable compression, and set packetbuffer_file_* options. This ensures that no packets are lost if the connection to the remote
# sniffer becomes unstable. The system will attempt to reconnect in case of failure.
# Packets are mirrored along with their original timestamps and headers.
# note: for mirroring packets use the newer client/server described above with enabled  packetbuffer_sender = yes

# Sender Configuration

# sip send ########################
# The sip_send feature allows the system to send SIP packets over either TCP or UDP based on your configuration.
# To use TCP, set the destination and port using sip_send. To use UDP, enable the sip_send_udp option.
# If you want the packet to be sent immediately rather than being buffered, set sip_send_before_packetbuffer to 'yes'.
# Note that this feature is NOT intended for mirroring SIP packets to the voipmonitor sniffer but is designed for
# interacting with third-party applications.

# WARNING: Please note that each SIP packet sent to the sip_send destination is appended with an extra 2 bytes
# indicating the length of the SIP packet. This is important for the receiving application to note.
#
# For testing, you can use netcat (nc) to listen for incoming packets on the destination server.
# To test using TCP: nc -l 192.168.0.2 -p 1555
# To test using UDP: nc -l 192.168.0.2 -p 1555 -u

# scan pcap dir ################
# This feature enables the scanning of pcap files stored in a specific directory. This is useful when running tcpdump
# to create pcap files at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 seconds using the -G 5 option). Tcpdump stores these files
# in a specified directory (e.g., /dev/shm/voipmonitor), which voipmonitor scans and processes.
# If the sniffer can process the pcap files in real-time, you'll find only one or two pcap files in the directory.
# However, if the sniffer can't keep up due to I/O or CPU bottlenecks, the number of pcap files will increase.

# WARNING: Versions of libpcap older than 1.1 have a memory leak issue when a pcap filter is set.

# Example tcpdump command for generating pcap files:
# nice -n -20 tcpdump -B500000 -i eth2 udp -G 5 -w /dev/shm/voipmonitor/voipmonitor 2>/dev/null 1>/dev/null &
# Directory to scan for pcap files
#scanpcapdir = /dev/shm/voipmonitor

# Voipmonitor will, by default, read any new files created in the scanpcapdir directory as soon as they are closed.
# This is the usual setting if you're using tcpdump for packet capturing. However, if you're using different capturing software,
# you might need to change this setting to "rename", especially if the software writes to a temporary file first and renames it later.
# Default setting is "newfile".
#scanpcapmethod = newfile
# end scan pcap dir ###############

# NAT ######################
# If both the SIP(media) server and client are behind NAT, you can specify aliasing for correct packet sniffing.
# Typically, voipmonitor can track both RTP streams based on the remote side's IP address. However, if the
# RTP stream is coming from a different IP than that used for SIP signaling—especially if both are behind NAT—
# it's difficult to track the correct IP.
# note: this is needed in case SIP server is traslated on firewall from public IP to private IP
# Use 'natalias' to specify alias IP addresses for NAT situations. You can use multiple natalias definitions 
#natalias = 1.1.1.1 10.0.0.3
#natalias = 1.1.1.2 10.0.0.3
#natalias = 1.1.1.3 10.0.0.4

# NAT Helper Option:
# If a SIP device (with source IP 1.1.1.1) sends in its SDP that it wants to establish an RTP connection to 10.0.0.1:10000,
# enabling 'sdp_reverse_ipport' will allow voipmonitor to also sniff RTP from 1.1.1.1:10000 or to 1.1.1.1:10000.
# Be cautious while using this option as it may introduce more problems than solutions.
# Default is 'no'.
#sdp_reverse_ipport = no

# To ignore certain RTP streams based on IP or IP:port combination, use 'sdp_ignore_ip_port' or 'sdp_ignore_ip'.
# This can be useful to exclude specific devices or ports from being monitored.
# Examples:
# sdp_ignore_ip_port = 192.168.0.1:100
# sdp_ignore_ip_port = 192.168.0.2:101
#sdp_ignore_ip = 192.168.0.1

# RTP Tracking and SDP Processing Configuration

# SDP Multiplication
# Controls how many calls can share the same IP:port combination for RTP streams based on SDP data.
# Be cautious: enabling this could lead to high disk usage as RTP packets will be stored for multiple calls.
# Setting to 0 will associate RTP packets only with the newest call.
# Default value is 3.
#sdp_multiplication = 0

# Disable SDP Processing
# Disabling SDP processing is advisable only for very high call rates (> 1000 CPS).
# This will disable RTP tracking based on SDP.
# Default is 'no'.
#disable_process_sdp = yes

# RTP Duplication Elimination
# Default behavior assigns RTP streams based on destination IP:port from SDP,
# which can cause multiple RTP streams to be associated with a single call.
# Enabling this feature also checks the source IP:port to avoid duplicates.
#
# Available options:
#   no                - Disable the feature (default).
#   yes               - Enable verification of both sides (src/dst) per SDP.
#   keep_rtp_packets  - Same as 'yes' but also stores extra/unverified RTP
#                       packets for debugging purposes.
#   strict            - Verify both sides per SDP. Unverified RTP packets are
#                       temporarily allowed UNTIL at least one RTP packet in
#                       the caller/direction is successfully verified. After
#                       the first verified packet, only verified packets pass.
#   very_strict       - Verify both sides per SDP. NO unverified RTP packets
#                       are allowed to pass at any time.
#
# Recommended:
#   - Use 'strict' if you need protection against duplicates but want to avoid
#     initial packet loss before the first verified packet arrives.
#   - Use 'very_strict' for maximum enforcement (may drop early packets until
#     verification succeeds).
#

# TAR File Storage Configuration for SIP/RTP/GRAPH
#
# Note: Changing the default configuration is not recommended unless you are sure of what you're doing.
#
# Why TAR: Storing numerous individual pcap files can strain the filesystem with high random write IOPS.
#          TAR files serialize these writes into a single stream, which can then be compressed more efficiently.
#
# TAR Filename Format: start of the call - year-mon-day/hour/minute/sip.tar
#
# Enabling TAR-level compression will override individual pcap compression settings.
# 
# default voipmonitor configuration is: 
# sip pcaps are concatenated in sip.tar and compressed by zstd level 3 (sip.tar.zstd)
# RTP pcaps are compressed individually by LZ4 and concatenated in uncompressed tar file (rtp.tar) 
# graph files are concatenated in tar file compressed by zstd level 3 (graph.tar.zstd)
#
# Without tar compression, the sniffer logs the offset for each file in the database. This ensures that 
# extracting that pcap file from the tar file is efficient with minimal I/O seeks (default for rtp tar) 
#
# Enabling compression for SIP/RTP or GRAPH will automatically deactivate options: 
# pcap_dump_zip, pcap_dump_zip_sip, pcap_dump_zip_rtp, and pcap_dump_zip_graph.

############################################################
# IPFIX (IP Flow Information Export) — RTP QoS ingestion
# Tested with Oracle/ACME SBC; other exporters may differ.
#
# What this does:
# - Listens for IPFIX messages on ipfix_bind_ip:ipfix_bind_port.
# - Extracts QoS info about RTP streams and writes it into CDRs.
# - Raw RTP/RTCP packets are NOT expected inside IPFIX.
#
# Data written (selected caller/called RTP streams):
#   a_saddr / b_saddr  .......... RTP src IPs
#   a_received / b_received ..... total RTP packets
#   a_lost / b_lost ............. lost RTP packets
#   a_mos_f2_mult10 / b_mos_f2_mult10 ... MOS (IPFIX f2), value*10
#
# Optional:
#   - All observed RTP streams → table `cdr_rtp`
#       (enable: ipfix_qos_fill_rtp_streams = yes)
#   - Codec identifier (1 byte, exporter-specific)
#       (enable: ipfix_qos_fill_codec = yes)
#   - Jitter RTP/RTCP {max,avg} (exporter-specific, likely in RTP ticks)
#       (enable: ipfix_qos_fill_jitter = yes)
#
# Notes on codec/jitter:
# - Exporter docs are ambiguous: codec is a single byte shared by all streams;
#   jitter appears to be in RTP timestamp ticks and may require conversion
#   using the codec clock rate. Therefore both are OFF by default.

# Ribbon SBC Mirroring / ribbonsvc  #
#####################################
# for the setting on Ribbon SBC -  https://www.voipmonitor.org/doc/Ribbon7k_monitoring_profiles
#
# This module handles Ribbon SBC "monitoring profile" mirrored SIP/RTP data.
# It supports two modes:
#   1) Passive sniffing  – substitute src/dst IP:port in already sniffed traffic
#   2) Active listener   – accept Ribbon "monitoring profile" feed on a local socket
#
# It is similar to "Kamailio Mirroring using siptrace", but uses a minimal header set.

###########
# MODE 1: PASSIVE SNIFFING (no socket opened)
#
# Quick enable:
#   ribbonsbc = yes
# When enabled, VoIPmonitor will try to detect and apply IP:port substitutions
# if substitution content is present in sniffed packets.
#
# Optional narrowing (legacy but still supported):
#   Use the triplet below to restrict which mirrored packets should be considered.
#   Keep using this if you need explicit filtering; otherwise just set ribbonsbc = yes.
#
# ribbonsbc_port  = 9514          # expected mirror port seen in packets (legacy filter)
# ribbonsbc_dstip = 10.0.0.1      # VoIPmonitor host IP as seen by Ribbon (legacy filter)
# ribbonsbc_srcip = 10.0.0.2      # Ribbon SBC IP (legacy filter)
#
# Note: If 'ribbonsbc' is enabled (yes/NO), substitution is attempted whenever
# substitution content is found. Same idea applies to 'kamailio' (see below).

###########
# MODE 2: ACTIVE LISTENER (open a socket and ingest feed directly)
#
# Bind an explicit local IP/port to receive Ribbon monitoring data. If these are set,
# the sniffer will listen and process incoming Ribbon data on this socket.
#
# ribbonsbc_bind_ip   = 0.0.0.0   # listen address (required to enable active mode)
# ribbonsbc_bind_port = 9514      # listen port (required to enable active mode)
#
# Transport & framing:
# ribbonsbc_bind_udp    = no      # yes/NO – UDP support (default NO; TCP recommended)
# ribbonsbc_size_header = YES     # YES/no – expect 2-byte size header before each frame
# ribbonsbc_strict_check= no      # yes/NO – process only frames complete per size header
#
# Instrumentation:
# ribbonsbc_counter_log = no      # yes/NO – log counts of incoming Ribbon frames
#
# TIP: Active listener generally makes sense with TCP (default). UDP is rarely useful.

###########
# SUBSTITUTION SWITCHES (shared idea with Kamailio)
#
# These switches only control whether src/dst IP:port substitution is attempted in
# normally sniffed traffic when substitution content is present. If enabled and
# a substitution block is detected, it is applied without having to predeclare
# specific IP:ports (unlike the legacy triplet).
#
# kamailio  = no   # yes/NO – enable Kamailio-style substitution on sniffed traffic
# ribbonsbc = yes  # yes/NO – enable Ribbon-style substitution on sniffed traffic

###########
# RECOMMENDATIONS
#
# - Use MODE 1 (passive) with:  ribbonsbc = yes
#   Only add ribbonsbc_port/dstip/srcip if you need strict filtering by IP/port.
#
# - Use MODE 2 (active) when Ribbon sends the monitoring profile feed directly to you:
#     ribbonsbc_bind_ip   = 0.0.0.0
#     ribbonsbc_bind_port = 9514
#   Keep ribbonsbc_bind_udp = no unless you explicitly need UDP.
#
# - Leave ribbonsbc_size_header = YES unless you know Ribbon is sending raw frames.
# - Enable ribbonsbc_strict_check = yes if you want to drop any incomplete frames.
#
# DEFAULTS (implicit unless set):
#   ribbonsbc = no
#   kamailio  = no
#   ribbonsbc_bind_udp = no
#   ribbonsbc_size_header = YES
#   ribbonsbc_strict_check = no
