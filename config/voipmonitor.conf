# mariadb >= 10.1.22 (https://mariadb.com/kb/en/innodb-page-compression/) can do innodb page compression which is superior to ROW_FORMAT - for mysql the new innodb page compression is controlled by innodb_compression_algorithm=lz4 in your mariadb configuration (check if lz4 is compiled by checking Innodb_have_lz4) and set mysqlcompress_type=PAGE_COMPRESSED=1
# tip: one of the main difference between ROW_FORMAT and innodb page compression is that the old way (ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED) keeps both compressed and uncompressed page in innodb buffer pool while the new innodb page compression keeps only uncompressed. The other advantage is that if gzip is bottleneck you can use very fast lz4 compression

# Client's sensors in database are created dynamically by server's sensor.
# Communication between server/client is encrypted.
# Can be only one server's sensor for now, the other sensors must be clients. Old fashioned remote sensors can be used together.
# Implicitly, client process a data, saves a pcaps to a local spooldir, sent the sql inserts/queries to the server's sensor
# and server's sensor does the whole sql operations. So on client side isn't needed any sql setting.
# Modification of this process can be done in client configuration.

# temporarily slow the sender will not loose single packet. The mirroring is trying to reconnect in case of
# failure. Packets are mirrored including the the original timestamp and headers.
